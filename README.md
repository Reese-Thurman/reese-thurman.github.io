## Capstone Project – *The Banking Game*

The **Banking Game** is a Python-based financial simulation that challenges players to reach $1,000,000 in assets before retirement.  
The project showcases my skills in:

- **Software Design & Engineering:** Modular design, maintainable structure, and encapsulated functionality.  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Use of randomization, compound interest calculations, and event handling.  
- **Databases:** SQLite integration for persistent data and player tracking.
